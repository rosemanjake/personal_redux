# The Bear

George knelt over the droppings and prodded them with a stick. They certainly looked like they could have come from a bear. The fibrous texture was a match for a creature that feasted on berries and pine nuts. However, that meant the bear had not eaten meat recently. It would surely be waiting to make a meal of the first deer, moose, or lone hiker it could catch. George massaged the cool aluminium of his bear spray canister and stood back up.

Naturally, the trip had not been George’s idea. His mother had insisted that he go. She had grown up in Wyoming and later she took George’s father hiking there many times when they were still young. In all those years, they had only seen a handful of bears. Each time, the creature had been many harmless miles away. They had never surprised a mother bear with cubs coming around a corner, never been stalked as prey on the trail, and had never been attacked, dismembered, and promptly devoured. “It will be fine,” she had said. “Your father was never afraid.”

George surveyed the area. He was several hours’ walk from the trailhead. The track had taken him at first through dense pine forest. There many of the trees were dead and desiccated. However, there had been no obvious sign of fire. It appeared as if they had recently passed a fatal disease through the soil between one another. Past the dead forest and a series of more lively meadows, he had come to a range of hills and gullies where the trail continually rose and fell. There he came to one of the area’s many small lakes. An ancient glacier had gauged it out of the mountain and polished the limestone around it into low and smooth hillocks. The lake’s clear water was ringed with stout pines and alpine heath. No hulking creatures appeared to stalk its blanks.

There had been a sign at the trailhead concerning bears. It displayed the silhouettes of both the black and grizzly bear, the former bulking and ominous and the latter even more so. Printed atop the sign in large red letters was the word DANGER. George was already familiar with much of the information it relayed. Before the trip, he had watched countless videos outlining how to respond to the different species of bear, defuse dangerous encounters, and react to a deadly attack. At the trailhead, he tried to send his mother a picture of the sign, but he had already lost signal.

His mother said that such a trip would be good for him. She told him that it would help him move on and finally relax. But all he could think at that moment was how great a pleasure it would be to turn around right there, go straight to his car, drive directly to the airport, and take the very next flight back to Boston. He planned to camp by Island Lake just off the trail, but he was sure he would not sleep at all. Fear was certain to keep him fully alert through the night. He did not even know how to make a fire to keep the unknown at bay. Despite all this urging, he pushed himself forward. He had promised his mother that he would reach Island Lake. There he would take a photo of himself that matched the one of his father that she had taken twenty years earlier.

The trail was muddy in parts where rivulets trickled down to meet the lake. George watched the mud for any palm-sized prints with five digits and evident claws. There were many boot prints, some fresh and some old. Occasionally the trail was marked by round horseshoes and grassy horse droppings. On the far side of the lake, George reached a particularly muddy stretch where the water drained into a gentle gully. There he found the unmistakable print of an animal neither human nor equestrian. The mark was fresh and came from a creature with sharp and ready claws, but in the loose mud he could not judge whether the print had four or five digits. He reached out a hand to measure the size of the print and found that it encompassed the entirety of his palm. It pointed in the same direction George was heading.

He continued along as the trail descended once again into the gully, zig-zagging back and forth along the steep hillside. He watched the woods alongside him as he went. Black bears are most dangerous when they stalk a person as they only do so when they have every intention of killing and eating them. For that reason, you must resist when a black bear attacks, the risk of injury making the meal too costly for the beast. Sometimes between the trees George would catch sight of a fresh stump with bright golden wood exposed, or a rock with an unusually bright species of lichen. In response to each of these unexpected glimpses, he whipped his head about to examine them more closely, always relieved to see what was truly there.

He filled his water bottles at a river crossing just down from a large waterfall. The sound of the surging water overwhelmed all the noise of the woods and George could no longer hear any singing birds, tapping woodpeckers, or buzzing insects. He startled at the thought and jumped to his feet, his bottle only half full. By the waterfall he would not hear the disgruntled grumbling of a disturbed bear just out of sight. In a rush, he skipped across the stones that peeked out above the water, very nearly slipping on the last of the slime-covered domes. Although already exhausted from the morning’s hike, he darted up the switchbacks and out of the gully.

Once away from the waterfall, George stopped to catch his breath. He listened to the sounds around him. The trees and grasses stirred. Countless birds sang. Mosquitoes buzzed in his ear, and his hand slapped against his skin as he swatted them. 

Of all the bear videos he had watched, a large share of them had concerned the proper use of bear spray. It was essentially pepper spray, only less potent than that used to incapacitate humans. Bear spray should merely confuse and disturb a bear, not hurt it. You must aim the bear spray below the bear’s nose and sweep side to side, letting loose with one second bursts. Doing so creates a cloud of irritant that partially blinds a bear and takes away its sense of smell. This usually results in the beast turning tail and running away. George repeated these facts in his mind. He edged around every corner in the path quite ready to unleash his capsaicin on the fiend that could very well have been just ahead.

George’s father had once told him a story about an animal he had encountered at night in Utah. It had come into his camp with heavy footfalls whose animal pattern stirred him awake. Naturally he could not see the creature through the tent and in the absence of certainty, he assumed it was a bear. He sat alert with his knife in one hand and his bear spray in the other. While the creature stood close to the tent it did not sniff or scratch at it. It remained perfectly still and quiet before walking away with the same heavy footfalls, crushing the undergrowth as it went. The rest of the night his heart did not stop racing. Just the movement of a distant chipmunk was enough to snap him awake. What dreams he had were full only of the most ravenous, murderous, hateful bears. In the morning he rose at dawn to find not a bear but a small group of elk just down by the river. He watched the sun rise and listened to them bugle.

Coming around a particularly dense stand of trees, George spotted three men ahead of him on the path. They were no more than twenty yards off. They wore a common uniform, olive green and khaki. These three were however not alone. Behind them was a hulking, stumbling beast, standing several feet tall with dark fur and slow loping strides. Stalking them for hours, it was now ready to pounce, ready to tear them apart and devour every scrap of flesh upon them and every morsel of viscera within them.

George immediately raised his can of bear spray and called out, “Hey! Hey! There’s a bear right behind you!”

The three figures halted and turned about. They adjusted their hats to block the sun from their eyes and stood watching and pointing with inexplicable nonchalance. Meanwhile, the creature following them had also turned around. Spotting George, it came bounding towards him. It moved much more quickly than he had anticipated, closing the gap between them in seconds. He however did not let loose his bear spray. Rather, he returned it to its holster. The creature was no bear but a dog, a large Newfoundland with a dark coat of fur, wagging tail, and lapping tongue. It wriggled before George and he reached down to pet it. It jumped excitedly up and down, bouncing on unusually large paws.

George went to the three rangers with the dog by his side. The nearest of them smiled and said, “Did you say there was a bear? Not sure we heard you right.”

“Sorry. I came around the trees back there and when I saw the dog, I thought it was a black bear for sure.”

They laughed together and assured him his mother was right to say the chance of running into a bear was really very low. They were Forest Service rangers who had been in the area for more than a week already. Their task was to maintain the trails. 

“So what’s the dog for?” George asked.

“Lucky just keeps us company. He’s my dog. He loves it out here.”

George told them he was planning to reach Island Lake that evening to take a photo for his mother. The rangers said they were going to camp there as well. They reached the lake just as the sun was setting. George showed the rangers the photo of his father and asked them to take him to the area where his mother had likely taken it. They knew just the spot and led him up a low hill that overlooked the valley. 

The lake was the largest they had seen all day, a long body of clear water reaching for several kilometers north to south. It was bounded to the East by Fremont Peak, a broad mountain that stood proud over the basin. Like tour guides, the rangers pointed to the mountain’s sharp slopes and described to George the processes by which the glaciers had carved away the rock.

George passed his phone to one of the rangers and posed before the view. The three rangers huddled around the screen. They discussed among themselves how best to match the original image. George followed their directions and back and forth to make sure he was in just the right spot. Lucky was at their heels as if attempting to make a contribution.

That night the rangers showed George how to make a fire. They sat around it and toasted dried sausages over the flames. They traded stories, and pointed out constellations. On the horizon, George thought he saw another distant campfire between the trees that lined a distant ridgeline. After some deliberation, the rangers determined that it was only Mars. George insisted it was too fire-like to be a planet. The earth continued to turn and the light rose into the sky to prove the rangers right. Lucky lay on her stomach by the fire and gazed at her friends.

Although George was stinky, sticky, and covered in mosquito bites, he crawled into his sleeping bag and slept more easily than any night since the accident.
