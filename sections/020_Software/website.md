# Personal Website

One of the most fun projects I have worked on is the website you are currently looking at. My goals were several:

<ul>
<li><strong>Improve web development fundamentals</strong>: To ensure I was improving my knowledge of full-stack web development, I chose to minimise my use of frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Easy deployment</strong>: I wanted to build something that I could deploy and update easily, as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Simple content management</strong>: Similarly, I wanted a system for drafting and publishing content that would be fun to work with through time.</li>
</ul>

If you would like to view the source, you will find the code [here on my GitHub](https://github.com/rosemanjake/personal_redux).

## Front End

The front end of the website is relatively simple, as you can likely tell I rely on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I don't use any large frameworks such as React or Sass, nor even JQuery. This forced me to work directly with the DOM and ensure that I understand 

## Back End

The back end is similarly simple. I run a Node Express server with a series of endpoints for delivering the content of the website to the browser. This was my first project to use node and I was quite 

After experiencing Flask and ASP.NET backends, I was very pleased with how simple and truly unopiniated Node and Express are together. It certainly seemed that I could spend more time writing code and solving problems and less time learning the framework's peculiar approach to something simple.

### Text Parsing

A key part of the back end is the text parser. 

## Single Page App

The website is a single page app.

## Design

I wanted to build a website that was simple, modern, and relatively understated. I reviewed examples of other personal websites, took some key elements from several that I liked, and combined them together in a (somewhat) unique design. After all, you know what they say about great artists.

### Design Approach

There were several basic design precepts that I took care to follow:

<ul>
<li><strong>Alignment of elements</strong>: .</li>
<li><strong>Consistent font sizes</strong>: .</li>
<li><strong>Subdued pallet</strong>: .</li>
</ul>

## Gallery

The gallery was perhaps the most fun
